# GPS-holder

This repository contains CAD source files for two 3d printed devices I designed to secure a GPS unit and it's antenna (puck) a ship. There are two parts, the casing for the GPS body and the bracket to hold the puck.

This snap-fit casing protects the GPS's main body and includes magnets embedded so that it can be magnetically attached to the wall of the ship. The top section includes a metal washer that allows the GPS puck to be magnetically mounted and "fingers" that allow the cable to be wrapped around them.

## Puck Holder

This bracket attaches via magnets and a strap to a rail on the ship and provides a flat surface for the GPS puck to be attached. The top section includes a metal washer that allows the GPS puck to be magnetically mounted.
